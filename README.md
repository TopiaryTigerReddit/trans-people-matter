# Trans People Matter
A site dedicated to connecting people with information on how they can help the trans community under the Trump administration.

# Want to contribute?
I welcome pull requests! I'm not much of a front-end developer, so if anyone wants to help make the site look a little nicer, that would be fantastic. Feel free to file an issue as well. This will help give an idea
of where to take development from here

# Local development
1) Clone the repo
2) Run `bundle install`
3) Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`

That's all you need for a local dev environment. For more info on Jekyll, see their docs [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
